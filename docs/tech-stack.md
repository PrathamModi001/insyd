# Tech Stack for Insyd Notification System

## Frontend
- **Next.js**: React framework providing both client-side and server-side rendering capabilities
- **React**: Component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **Socket.io-client**: WebSocket client for real-time notifications
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development without focusing too much on aesthetics (as per requirements)

## Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server
- **Express**: Web framework for building REST APIs
- **Socket.io**: WebSocket server for real-time communication
- **Kafkajs**: Node.js client for Apache Kafka
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB ODM for easier interaction with the database

## Data Storage
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database offering flexible schema design, ideal for notification data that may evolve over time

## Message Broker
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant handling of notification events
- **Zookeeper**: Required for Kafka cluster coordination

## Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the codebase
- **Docker**: For containerizing services and simplifying local development
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting

## Deployment
- **Vercel**: For hosting the Next.js frontend
- **Railway/Render**: For hosting the Node.js backend services
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-hosted MongoDB

## Testing
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertions for API testing

## Rationale for Key Technology Choices

### Why Kafka?
- **Decoupling**: Kafka allows us to decouple producers (user actions) from consumers (notification processing)
- **Reliability**: Kafka's persistence ensures notifications won't be lost even if services go down
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle millions of events as the platform grows
- **Ordering**: Maintains event ordering when needed, crucial for time-sensitive notifications

### Why MongoDB?
- **Flexible Schema**: Notification content may vary based on type
- **Query Capabilities**: Efficient querying for notification feeds and counts
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling via sharding for future growth
- **JSON Format**: Native handling of JSON data aligns well with JavaScript-based stack

### Why WebSockets?
- **Real-time**: Enables pushing notifications instantly to users
- **Efficiency**: More efficient than polling for new notifications
- **User Experience**: Creates a responsive, interactive notification experience

### Why Next.js?
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Offers both SSR and CSR capabilities
- **API Routes**: Simplifies backend API creation
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with features like code splitting
- **Deployment**: Easy deployment on Vercel
